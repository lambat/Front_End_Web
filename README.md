# Introduction
This project is website based written using three languages: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. This README file will aim to explain the motivation why I decided to choose this particular project. This file will also include intital wireframs, hand drawn plans of each section. There will also be a section which shows evidence of using user testing conducted by other users with feedback to act upon.

## Motivation
I decided to create a website based on DIY as this shop is actually ran by my father. It is a real shop based in the heart of Leicester. As he does not currently have a website and with his constant nagging of me creating one for him, I decided this would be the best situation to create one as I can hit two birds with one stone - creating something which means something to me and an initial idea of a website for my father.

# Design Documentation
The following link is for the initial design:

# Design Principles (PARC)
1. **P** - Proximity - This has been achieved by using an even amount of images when grouped together. This can be best seen on the about us section where all 4 columns are aligned together and the products section where all 6 images are equally grouped together.
2. **A** - Alignment - In the case of this website, the entire or majority of the website is inside a <main> tag and this made it easier to align all the items in a correct manner.
3. **R** - Repetition - Each section contains the same <h1> tag and can be clearly seen where each section begins/ends. There is also a navigation bar which follows the user as they scroll along the page and this brings confidence to the user                      to ensure they know where everything is located on the website.
4. **C** - Contrast - Only three colour's are used throughout the website to give a consistency which are: Navy blue, grey and black.. This is manipulated well throughout the website and this is to match the logo colour's which constrasts well and easily readable for any user.

# Design Features
- **User's can enter their name** - This design was created to welcome users to the website and make them feel at home and stores their name unless they press the clear storage button and refresh the page which will default back to the  original setting.
- **Mobile First** - The website was designed observing the Mobile First approach which ensures the best results for a responsive design.
- **Use of API** - An external API was used appropriately to highlight the location (Google Maps) of where the shop is located.
- **Validated Webpages** - The index.html file passed the validation test for HTML with no major/cautionary errors.
- **Responsive Layout** - This website follows a responsive layout as explained from the Mobile First Approach. This is best represented by the title which reduces in size and readjusts, as well as the nav bar which collapses and hides the menu buttons creating a nice hamburger effect.

# Obstacles
- The biggest obstacle was getting the Google map API to load correctly on my Github page. After two days of trying every possible thing I could to fix it, I decided to validate my website and it picked the error out which was a simple and easy error to make. The // was missing from the url which was causing the Google Maps API to not load correctly.

# Testing
